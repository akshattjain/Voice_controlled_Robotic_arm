Overview
Welcome to the Robotic Arm Voice Control project! This repository contains Python code that allows you to control a robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom using voice commands. The project utilizes speech recognition to interpret commands and translate them into movements of the robotic arm.

Features
Voice Recognition: Use voice commands to control the robotic arm.
3 Degrees of Freedom: Control the arm's base rotation, elbow, and wrist movements.
Real-time Operation: Commands are processed in real-time for immediate response.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software and hardware:

Hardware
A robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom
A microphone for voice input
A computer or microcontroller to run the Python code
Software
Python 3.x
SpeechRecognition library
PyAudio library
Serial library (if communicating with a microcontroller via serial)
Any other libraries specific to your robotic arm's control
